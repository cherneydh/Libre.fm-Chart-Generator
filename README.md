## Version 0.1

This is planning on being the bear bones proof-of-concept version of the website. It will take in a users libre.fm username and return a three by three image of the most recent albums to which they have listened.

**UPDATE 04-17-2018**
Currently putting the project on hold. The communication with the MusicBrainz API gives me a headache.

## Future features to be implemented

* Four by Four and Five by Five sizes
* Support for listing artist name, play count, and album name
* Changing the time frame for how the application grabs the albums
